  The Elevator Controller is a finite state machine I created with a partner in the course Engineering Cyber Phsyical Systems (2021). We used System Verilog in Vivado to program the seven segment display and push buttons of a Basys3 Board while also using the PMOD connectors to connect this Basys3 to an existing cyber physical system that we created using a Raspberry Pi. 
  This project replicates an actual elevator using the seven segment display to show when the elevator door is open/closed and what floor it is on. The push buttons are used to move the elevator between floor 1 and floor 4, with the middle push button used as the reset.
