        <h1>Intelligent Systems 1 - 2020</h1>
        <p>This course was primarily based in Python with a very hands on approach, 
            we used Jupyter notebooks to explore common techniques in artificial intelligence,
            machine learning, and agent based modeling. Below you will find examples of
             notebooks I created during this class along with a brief description. </p>
