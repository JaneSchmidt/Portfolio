The Fitness Tracker is an iOS mobile app that I created with two other people in the course Mobile App Development (2022) using Swift in Xcode. This app has four views; map view, table view, data comparison view, and add workout view. The purpose of the map view is to track and time any workouts that require you to move locations, for example running, biking, or walking. The purpose of the add workout view is to add a workout that does not need to be tracked, an example being an at home workout. The purposes of the table view and data comparison view are to show the data from the past workouts you have saved. The table view shows all the workouts in a table with the date completed and all information pertaining to the past workouts, while the data comparison view is a pop up segue that is triggered when you finish a tracked workout and it displays the distance and time from the current workout compared to the last workout of that category. Screenshots of these views can be found in the views pdf.
